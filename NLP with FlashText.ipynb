    "## FlashText, fast word replacement for NLP tasks\n",
    "##### By Ruben Seoane, adaptation of Analytics Vhidhya https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/11/flashtext-a-library-faster-than-regular-expressions/, all credit goes to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "When performing NLP tasks, it's usually necessary to search and substitute for certain words during the pre-processing stage.\n",
    "Some cases:\n",
    "    1. Variations of a verbal form _\"would've\"_ for _\"would have\"_\n",
    "    2. Changing case variations and mispellings, like _rubY, Ruby, rUby.._\n",
    "    3. Replacing synonims of a word with one form i.e _happy, joyful, delightful_ to _happy_\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the task needs to be done for thousands of text snippets, utilizing Regular Expressions is a good solution, but when the task at hand includes millions of instances, this process can take up to days. This is where **Flashtext** comes into the picture, as it allows to perform this process within minutes."
